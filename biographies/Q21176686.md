# John Adams, Sr.
## Attended Yale Divinity School 1901-1902

John Adams, Sr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1876 to John and Belle Adams. By the time of the 1900 U.S. census, his mother was widowed and was living with his older brother.[^1]  In 1898, Adams matriculated to Lincoln University before attending Gammon Theological Seminary, graduating in 1901.[^2]  During the 1901 to 1902 academic year, Adams was enrolled at the Yale Divinity School.[^3]  In 1902, he married Hattie E. Bowman in Wilmington, North Carolina.[^4]  At some point before 1914, he obtained a master of arts degree from Campbell College in Jackson, Mississippi.[^5]

Although Adams did not receive a formal law education, he was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1905, where he began his law practice in Columbia, South Carolina.  Alongside his law practice, Adams pastored for the Pilgrim Congregational Church in Columbia.[^7]  From 1907 to 1908, he served as an instructor at Allen University.[^8]  In 1907, John Adams, alongside his co-counsel, Jacob Moorer, defended Pink Franklin, a Black contract laborer who shot a white constable in self-defense.[^9]  Franklin was found guilty, but Adams and Moorer argued that the trial was unconstitutional as the jury was all white, and South Carolina law prevented Black people from serving on a jury. The case managed to reach the Supreme Court where Adams and Moorer were advised by black leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois to allow a white lawyer, ex-United States Attorney General Charles Bonaparte, to argue the case. Adams and Moorer refused as they wanted to demonstrate the capabilities of Black lawyers.[^10]  In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled against Adams and Moorer’s attempts, claiming that South Carolina did not discriminate by race in jury selection. However, efforts from the NAACP allowed Franklin’s death penalty to be commuted.[^11]

After the trial, Adams was forced to leave his home after being driven out of town by white South Carolinians for his role in the trial.[^12]  He ended up in Spokane, Washington, by 1911, where he continued to practice law.[^13]  In Spokane, he criticized job discrimination against Black people and made speeches at the city hall.[^14]  He moved to Pueblo, Colorado, by 1914, where he oversaw the St. Paul A.M.E. Church that became a beacon to Black organizations in Colorado.[^15]  He later settled in Omaha, Nebraska, where he practiced law continuously for forty years and also served as a reverend to the A.M.E. chapter in the city.[^16]  By 1925, Adams became the presiding elder of the Omaha district of the A.M.E. church.[^17]  The A.M.E. church chose Adams to head the re-opened Greater Payne University in Birmingham, Alabama, where he served from 1932 to 1936. He was also active in the Urban League, the NAACP, and Prince Hall Freemasonry.[^18] 

In 1948, Adams was elected an Nebraska state senator for the fifth district, the second Black senator behind his son, John Adams Jr., who had served the fifth district previously.[^19]  He would go on to serve in the Nebraska State Senate for more than a decade and brought forward legislation to end discriminatory labor practices in Nebraska.[^20]  He passed away on April 21, 1962, while serving his seventh two-year term.[^21]
