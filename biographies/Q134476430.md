# William Andrew Harrod
## Attended Yale Divinity School 1901-1902

William Andrew Harrod was born on September 17, 1873, to John Harrod and a mother who has not yet been identified, in Baltimore, Maryland. His father and grandfather were both pastors. By the 1880 census, the Reverend John Harrod was a shoemaker and widowed with four children.1 In 1895, William A. Harrod graduated from Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C.[^2] In 1899, he attended Brown University as an undergraduate first-year, and later transferred to Yale Divinity School in 1900, attending Yale for a year.[^3] He married Nettie Watts, who also originated from Baltimore, in 1899 in Norwich, Connecticut.[^4] During his time at Yale, he was active in the Union A.M.E. Church in New Haven and spoke to the congregation celebrating John Brown’s anniversary.[^5]  

Harrod began his career in ministry in 1901 at the First Baptist Church of Milford. He later served at Shiloh Baptist Church in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1904 to 1915. He received praise for expanding membership and financing a new church for the congregation.[^6] During his time in Hartford, he was known for his work on improving racial relations, representing Black congregations in community events and preaching before 10,000 white Baptists in Northfield, Connecticut. Alongside Adam Clayton Powell (who attended Yale Divinity School, 1895-96), he was elected to serve as an officer of the New England Baptist Missionary Convention.[^7]  

In 1914, Harrod received a doctor of divinity degree from Virginia Theological Seminary.[^8] He later moved to Philadelphia to oversee the First African Baptist Church in Philadelphia and led it for more than 30 years.[^9] In Philadelphia, he was considered a leader of the city’s Black community. He established several clubs and societies in the church such as the Book Band Society, the Flower Club, the Benevolent Board, and the Cherry Blossoms. In 1929, he was elected vice president of the predominantly-white Baptist Ministers’ Conference in Philadelphia.10 During the Great Depression, Harrod was selected by the mayor of Philadelphia to join a committee in organizing relief measures for 25,000 unemployed African American.[^11] The committee would go on to organize soup kitchens, establish temporary shelters, and distribute coal and clothing for the needy.[^12] 

In 1947, Harrod died at the age of 74 from pulmonary embolism in Philadelphia. He was survived by his wife and daughter.[^13]
