# George Lafayette Camm
## Graduate of Yale Law School, 1880

George Lafayette Camm, who received an LL.B. degree (bachelor of laws) in 1880, is one of the earliest known Black graduates of Yale. Enrolling in the 1878-1879 academic year, Camm lived with Edwin Archer Randolph, another Black student studying law, at 39 Sperry Street in New Haven. 

Not much is definitively known of Camm’s life before or after he attended Yale. According to his alumni file, mail addressed to his address in Athens, Georgia (where he had listed his home address as a student), was returned in 1906. From the early 1900s through the 1940s, the university repeatedly made efforts to locate Camm, even placing a notice on the front page of the Athens, Georgia, Banner-Herald in 1923, seeking information.  The office of the alumni registrar also wrote letters to classmates and other people with the same surname seeking information, but without success. Although the university was not seeking payment of any debts, a note in his file dated July 10, 1939, explains that Camm was one of several graduates who never received their diplomas “because they failed to settle their indebtedness to the University.” His diploma is included in the Yale Diploma Collection (RU 150). There are no Camms listed in the Athens, Georgia, city directories of 1889,1894, 1897, 1904, or 1909. However, there is a George L. Camm, denoted as Black, listed in the Savannah, Georgia, directory of 1898.
