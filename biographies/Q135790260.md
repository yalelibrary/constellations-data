In 1912, he began teaching at Jackson College in Mississippi.  He married Ethel John Woolfolk, a teacher at the Braxton Industrial School, in 1916. In 1917, he taught at Virginia State College as an English professor. He eventually became the head of the English Department at Virginia State College. In 1930, he published two books on English grammar. After thirty years of teaching at Virginia State, he retired in 1947.
