Samuel Leon Brooks was born in Kingston, New York, to William H. and Julia Brooks. His father was originally from Maryland and served in the 2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment. His mother was from Connecticut. The family moved to Danbury where William operated a barbershop.[^1]  

In 1893, Samuel graduated from Danbury High School, winning a prize for best essay.2 He enrolled at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts where he attended until 1898. In his senior quote, he referenced lynchings.[^3] He enrolled at Yale College later in the year but only attended school for a year. He returned home to live with his father in Danbury where he identified as a law student.[^4] 

In August 1900, he married Lucy Carr in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and they had their only child, Julia, in 1902. His wife was a part of the Anti-Lynching Crusaders, a feminist organization advocating for an end to lynchings. He and his wife became servants for the Miller family in Hartford by 1910. By 1917, he worked as a waiter at the Hartford Club.5 He worked there for twenty years and eventually became head waiter at the social club.[^6] 

In 1915, Lucy and Samuel Brooks separated; their divorce was finalized in 1922.[^7] He remarried in August 1924 to Rhoda Diggs.[^8] In a 1927 letter to the organizers of the 25th Class Book Anniversary of the Class of 1902, Brooks shared that he felt ineligible for leaving after a year at Yale but thanked the organizers for keeping him in touch with the class.[^9] In 1929, Samuel L. Brooks suffered cardiovascular syphilis for six months, and accidentally fell out of a window, worsening his condition. He died on September 13, 1929.[^10]
