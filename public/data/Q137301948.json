Hudson\n## Attended Yale School of Art 1936-1937\n\nHenry Mercier Hudson was born in 1906 in Lumpkin, George but by the 1920 census, he was living in Hartford, Connecticut. He was raised by his single mother, Mary Elizabeth Ford, who worked as a janitress at a telephone board. He attended Howard University where he was the president of the Daubers Art Club and won the \u201cBest Artist\u201d superlative according to Howard\u2019s The Bison. He painted several murals across Washington D.C. with the New Deal\u2019s Public Works of Art Project program, painting \u201cHannibal, the Carthaginian\u201d for Garnet-Patterson School and \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d for Magruder School for Crippled Children. He also painted several murals for Howard University, including 5 for physical education. He was originally enrolled in the education program but shifted to the art department and graduated in 1935. The General Education Board of New York City provided him with a one-year scholarship to study at the Yale School of Fine Arts during the 1936-1937 school year. He also was a playwright and actor, acting in plays during his time at Howard University and eventually publishing _Phantom of Fern College: A Comedy in 3 Acts_ in 1936. According to his 1940 draft card, Hudson was residing in Philadelphia where he worked at the Philadelphia Recreation Company. In 1942, he enlisted into the United States army. In 1947, he was a chief designer for a mural project in Washington D.C. He died in 1983.[^1]\n\n[^1]:\"United States, Census, 1920\", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MCFR-DLZ : Thu Jan 16 13:54:05 UTC 2025), Entry for Mary Ford and Leola Hudson, 1920; _The Bison_: 1933.
