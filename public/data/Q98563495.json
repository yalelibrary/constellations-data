    "biographyMarkdown": "# Powell Daniel Lindsay\n## Attended Yale School of Drama 1935\n\nBorn in 1905 in Philadelphia, Powell Lindsay was a successful Black playwright, actor, and director. Raised in Phoebus, Virginia, he was the son of Henry Lindsay, born in Bluefield, West Virginia, and Addie E. Tower, born in Cape Charles, Virginia. His mother died in 1933. Lindsay trained to be a tailor at the St. Paul Normal School in Lawrenceville, Virginia. He later studied at Virginia Union University but did not receive a degree. In fall 1935, he entered the Yale School of Drama for playwriting, but he stayed only one term and left the program in December 1935. Lindsay had been recommended for admission by another Black student, Randolph Edmonds. In 1937, his troupe of Black performers won first honors in a Yale Drama tournament for their play \u201cMighty Wind A \u2018Blowin.\u201d \n\nHe was active in New York\u2019s Black theater scene before and after his time at Yale. A co-founder of the Harlem Suitcase Theater with Langston Hughes in 1937, Lindsay also co-founded the Negro Playwrights Company. In addition to the stage, he had a successful career in Black film as an actor, writer, and director. He acted in *Love in Syncopation* (1946), and he acted and wrote for *That Man of Mine* (1946), *Jivin\u2019 in Be-Bop* (1947), and *Souls of Sin* (1949). He starred in, directed, and produced plays including \u201cBig White Fog\u201d (1940) and, on Broadway, \u201cTobacco Road\u201d (1950) and \u201cBorn Yesterday\u201d (1953). \n\nLindsay was a member of the National Negro Congress, an executive officer of the New Theater League, and was active in the Works Progress Administration\u2019s Federal Theater Project. He was interested in exploring issues of class and race and was known for his Popular Front and leftist commitments early in his career. Film scholar Ellen C. Scott has called Lindsay \u201cthe last race filmmaker.\u201d[^1]\n\nIn the 1950s, Lindsay moved to Detroit, where he starred in television and produced a study on police brutality for the NAACP that was published in the *New York Times*. In 1965, he started the Research Association for Michigan Negro History. In the 1960s, he moved to Ann Arbor, where he worked at the State Legislative Service Bureau. In 1970s, he established a new Suitcase Theater. It was composed of Michigan young people across racial and economic backgrounds who performed across the world. Lindsay retired in 1979.[^2]\n\nLindsay\u2019s friendship with Langston Hughes dated to 1933, and they continued to work together into the 1960s. Their lengthy correspondence forms part of the Langston Hughes Papers at the Beinecke. Following the death of Hughes in 1967, Lindsay produced a play in his honor in Detroit titled \u201cLangston Hughes Looks at Dark America\u201d and used his role as research analyst in Michigan\u2019s Legislative Service Bureau to celebrate the life of Langston Hughes and his contributions to Black literature. Powell Lindsay died in 1987 at the age of 82 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. [^3]\n\n[^1]: Ellen C.
