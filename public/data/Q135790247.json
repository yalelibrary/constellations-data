    "biographyMarkdown": "# Ollington Erwin Smith \n## Attended Yale School of Drama 1934-1935 \n\nOllington Erwin Smith was born on July 18, 1908, in Houston, Texas to Nina Frances Erwin and Ernst Ollington Smith. His mother was a seamstress, and his father was a community leader within Houston, opening a library for African Americans and a principal of two high schools for Black students.[^1] \n\nDuring his adolescence he remained active with Houston\u2019s YMCA camp. At the age of 19, he put on a rendition of Laurence Houseman\u2019s *The Chinese Lantern* with the revenue from the show donated to the YMCA.[^2] In 1932, he became the secretary of the YMCA Camp Committee.[^3] \n\nHe first enrolled at the University of California at Los Angeles in the fall of 1927 before enrolling at his father\u2019s alma mater, Fisk University.[^4] During his time at UCLA, he pledged for Alpha Phi Alpha but later dropped from the process.[^5] In 1931, he received a bachelor of arts and then a master of arts at Fisk in 1934.[^6] From 1934 to 1935, Smith took graduate study at the Yale School of Fine Arts. He succeeded S. Randolph Edmonds, another Black alumnus who attended Yale, as director of dramatics as well as an English professor at Morgan College.[^7] \n\nAlongside being a playwright and professor, he was also an actor starring in the now-lost film *Children of Circumstances*.[^8] He also served the Negro Intercollegiate Dramatic Association as treasurer.[^9] During World War II, while teaching at Morgan College, he was drafted and served as a warrant officer from 1942 to 1946.[^10] In 1949, he moved back home to oversee Texas Southern University\u2019s drama program where he helped found the Little Theater and the Texas State University Players. He also oversaw Texas Southern University\u2019s debate program.[^11] After more than two decades overseeing the drama and debate program at Texas State, he would retire in 1972 and lived out his retirement as a Sunday school teacher and church trustee. He received the Silver Beaver Award in 1980.[^12] \n\nHe died on September 16, 1991, and was buried in Houston National Cemetery.[^13] In honor of his memory, Texas Southern University renamed the Little Theater to Ollington Smith Playhouse, and the Texas State University Players was renamed to the Ollington Smith University Players.  \n\n[^1]:\"United States, Census, 1910\", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M29W-X7F : Wed Aug 13 17:34:47 UTC 2025), Entry for Ernest O Smith and Mina E Smith, 1910; Patricia Prather, \u201cSmith, Ernest Ollington,\u201d Handbook of Texas Online, accessed September 05, 2025, https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/smith-ernest-ollington.  \n\n[^2]:\u201cTo Present 3-Act Play,\u201d *The Houston Informer*, July 23, 1927, 4.  \n\n[^3]:\u201cY.
