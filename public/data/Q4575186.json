She graduated from Wellesley College in 1928, then entered Yale Law School, graduating in 1931.\n\nAfter graduation, she worked with her father\u2019s legal practice in Poughkeepsie for a few years. In 1933, she married fellow attorney Ralph E. Mizelle and moved to New York City, where they practiced law together. Ralph Mizelle died in 1943. Bolin later married minister Walter P. Offutt, Jr. \n\nBolin ran for a New York state assembly seat in 1936. In 1939, she was appointed as a judge in the Family Court of New York, where she served for 40 years. She was an advocate for the rights of children and for education, civil rights, and the racial integration of public services for children and families.\n\nThe Yale Law School Association awarded her its Medal of Merit in 1994. A portrait of Bolin hangs in the Yale Law School.\n\nBolin died in 2007 at age 98.\n\nImage citation: Library of Congress LC-USF344- 007933-ZB [P&P] LOT 953 (via Wikimedia Commons)\n",
