He attended Fisk University, where he studied chemistry and was mentored by Yale alumnus George Edmund Haynes. After graduating from Fisk in 1917, he attended Yale Divinity School for a year before entering the Army and serving in World War I. \n\nUpon his return from the war, he continued his divinity studies at the University of Chicago and also opened a cosmetics business, Chemical Manufacturing Company. He completed a master\u2019s of divinity in 1920. Around this time, he married his wife, Thelma Pierce.\n\nThe couple moved to South Bend, Indiana, where Gordon worked to establish an African Methodist Episcopal Church. He also studied Black life in South Bend, publishing The Negro of South Bend in 1922. Once the church was established, he left to become minister at another AME church in Akron, Ohio. While pastor there, he wrote Pastor and People (1930). In 1931, he ended his pastorship in Akron and took a position as Editor of Church School Literature for the AME Church. During this time, he also wrote Teaching for Abundant Living (1936). He served as a bishop for the AME Church, with appointments starting in 1936 and in 1944. He served on the executive committee of the NAACP.\n\nGordon died in 1952.\n",
