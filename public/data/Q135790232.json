    "biographyMarkdown": "# Cato Lafayette Baskervill\n## Graduate of Sheffield Scientific School, 1928\n\nCato Lafayette Baskervill (sometimes spelled Baskerville) was born in 1903 to Erasmus Lafayette and Mary Effie Baskervill in Henderson, North Carolina, but moved to South Carolina during his youth. His father was a clergy member who served in the United States Army for nearly a decade and was stationed in the Philippines. Following his discharge in 1903, Erasmus joined the Episcopal Church where he eventually became an archdeacon and oversaw Black churches and schools across South Carolina.[^1] \n\nAt the age of 16, Cato Lafayette Baskervill joined the United States Army and was a private in Company E of the 317th Engineers, a Black battalion. He was deployed to France in 1918 and returned to the U.S. in 1919. In 1920, he enrolled at St. Augustine College, a Black college in North Carolina, where Charles H. Boyer, an 1896 graduate of Yale College, served on the faculty. The following year, Baskervill went on to win the school\u2019s Barber Prize, which was a $10 award to the student who delivered the best original address. He graduated in 1924 and passed Yale\u2019s examination board, enrolling at the Sheffield Scientific School. Amidst a decline in Black college attendance at Yale in the 1920s, newspapers lavished praise on Baskervill, with the *New York Age* highlighting the honors he received at Yale within all his subjects. He graduated from the Sheffield Scientific School in 1928.[^2] \n\nAccording to the 1930 census, Baskervill returned home and worked as a chemist testing gases. He later moved to New York and worked as an inspector at the Department of Water Supply, Gas, and Electricity. At the same time, he joined the New York National Guard and was assigned to the 369th Infantry Regiment (nicknamed the \u201cHarlem Hellfighters\u201d). In 1935, he married Fannie Palmer who was from New Haven, Connecticut.[^3] \n\nBaskervill had a successful military career like his father. In 1942, he became a major and, in 1944, oversaw Black regiments that manned anti-air guns in New Guinea. In 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel with the unit receiving praise for their service. Following World War II, he became a commanding officer for the 369th regiment and oversaw the regiment\u2019s training with anti-air guns.[^4] \n\nBaskervill died in 1957 in New Rochelle, New York, and was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.[^5] \n\n[^1]: \u201cShort Illness Fatal to S.
