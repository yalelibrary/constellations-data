His father was originally from Maryland and served in the 2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment. His mother was from Connecticut. The family moved to Danbury where William operated a barbershop.[^1]  \n\nIn 1893, Samuel graduated from Danbury High School, winning a prize for best essay.2 He enrolled at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts where he attended until 1898. In his senior quote, he referenced lynchings.[^3] He enrolled at Yale College later in the year but only attended school for a year. He returned home to live with his father in Danbury where he identified as a law student.[^4] \n\nIn August 1900, he married Lucy Carr in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and they had their only child, Julia, in 1902. His wife was a part of the Anti-Lynching Crusaders, a feminist organization advocating for an end to lynchings. He and his wife became servants for the Miller family in Hartford by 1910. By 1917, he worked as a waiter at the Hartford Club.5 He worked there for twenty years and eventually became head waiter at the social club.[^6] \n\nIn 1915, Lucy and Samuel Brooks separated; their divorce was finalized in 1922.[^7] He remarried in August 1924 to Rhoda Diggs.[^8] In a 1927 letter to the organizers of the 25th Class Book Anniversary of the Class of 1902, Brooks shared that he felt ineligible for leaving after a year at Yale but thanked the organizers for keeping him in touch with the class.[^9] In 1929, Samuel L. Brooks suffered cardiovascular syphilis for six months, and accidentally fell out of a window, worsening his condition. He died on September 13, 1929.[^10] \n\n[^1]:  https://archives-library.wcsu.edu/first-black-graduate-of-danbury-high-school/; https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28511664/william_h-brooks; *Carter\u2019s Danbury Directory For 1886-7, Containing A General Directory Of The Citizens, Also A Business And Street Directory And An Appendix of Useful Information* (Newburgh, NY: Carter & Company, 1886), 192. \n[^2]:  \u201cFairfield County News,\u201d *The Newtown Bee*, June 30, 1893, https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/667875129/?match=1&terms=%22Samuel%20L.%20Brooks%22&pqsid=GRVdw7119VDtyvnU6vaHeQ%3A3041182%3A1953100462. \n[^3]:  https://archives-library.wcsu.edu/first-black-graduate-of-danbury-high-school/. \n[^4]:  *Crofutt\u2019s Danbury City Directory 1900* (Danbury, CT: Fred B.
