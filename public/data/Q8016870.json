    "biographyMarkdown": "# William Pickens\n## Graduate of Yale College, 1904\nWilliam Pickens was born on January 15, 1881 in Anderson County, South Carolina to formerly\nenslaved parents. He showed impressive academic achievement, graduating as valedictorian of\nUnion High School in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1899 and going on to graduate from Talladega\nCollege in Alabama in 1902 before receiving a second bachelor&#39;s degree from Yale. He\ngraduated in 1904 in the honors society Phi Beta Kappa and won prizes for his excellent\noratory. He would later also go on to receive a master\u2019s degree from Fisk University in Nashville,\nTennessee in 1908, a PhD in literature from Selma University in Alabama in 1915, and an LLD\nfrom Wiley University in Marshall, Texas in 1918, all while simultaneously pursuing a career in\nacademia.\n\nPickens married Minnie Cooper McAlpine of Meridian, Mississippi in 1905, with whom he would\nhave three children. His first post-graduate job was as a professor at Talladega College for ten\nyears, and he subsequently worked as dean of Morgan College in Baltimore, Maryland, from\n1915 to 1920. During this time he also began his prolific writing career, publishing a two-part\nautobiography under the titles of *The Heir of Slaves* (1911) and *Bursting Bonds* (1923),\nreflecting on his upbringing, education, and participation in the Harlem Renaissance. Pickens\nwas an active participant in the ongoing conversation in the 1910s and 1920s surrounding Black\ncivil rights and the \u201cNew Negro\u201d movement, publishing a collection of essays under the title *The\nNew Negro: His Political, Civil, and Mental Status* in 1916.\n\nAfter leaving academia in 1920, Pickens spent the next twenty years working for the NAACP,\nwhich he had been involved in since its founding in 1910. He helped establish the organization\u2019s\nLouisville branch and worked as a field secretary, becoming an influential public speaker and\nwriter who massively grew the organization\u2019s membership. After leaving the NAACP in 1942 he\nworked for the US Treasury Department, supporting the sale of savings bonds during WWII. He\nretired in 1951 and died while on a cruise in Jamaica on April 6, 1954.\n\nImage citation: Yale College Class of 1904 class book, Yale University Library\n",
