His father, Thomas, worked as a bricklayer. He received a preparatory education at the Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts where he won an oration contest in 1905 on the topic of race problems in the United States. He graduated from the school in 1906 and subsequently enrolled at Amherst College. In 1909, he was chosen as one of the \u201cKellogg Fifteen,\u201d which recognizes the students in the class for their oratory capabilities. After graduating from Amherst in 1910, he took a year of post-graduate studies of sociology and education at the Yale Graduate School. He would later receive a Master of Arts from Harvard in 1925. In 1912, he began teaching at Jackson College in Mississippi.  He married Ethel John Woolfolk, a teacher at the Braxton Industrial School, in 1916. In 1917, he taught at Virginia State College as an English professor. He eventually became the head of the English Department at Virginia State College. In 1930, he published two books on English grammar. After thirty years of teaching at Virginia State, he retired in 1947. Thomas Desire Pawley died on November 19, 1964, in Petersburg, Virginia, and was buried in Wilkerson Memorial Cemetery.[^1]\n\n[^1]\"United States, Census, 1880\", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M6SM-YD7 : Tue Oct 21 23:26:00 UTC 2025), Entry for Thomas Polly and Eugenia Polly, 1880; \u201cThe Negro\u2019s Best Hope,\u201d _The Greenfield Recorder_, March 1, 1905, 3; \u201cAmherst College,\u201d Boston Evening Transcript, March 5, 1909, 5; _Amherst Graduates\u2019 Quarterly_, vol 2 (Amherst, MA: Amherst College), 113; \"Mississippi, County Marriages, 1818-1979\", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:63BX-Q8MM : Mon Jan 20 18:38:19 UTC 2025), Entry for Thomas Desire Parley and Miss Ethel John Woolfolk, 7 Jun 1916; \u201cRetired Va.
