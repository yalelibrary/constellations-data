    "biographyMarkdown": "# Daniel Joseph Winge\n## Attended Yale Law School 1926-1927\n\nDaniel Joseph Winge was born on March 8th, 1905, in Darien, Georgia to Daniel H. and Georgia J. Winge.[^1] He enrolled at Rutgers University, majoring in Liberal Arts and was part of the college\u2019s YMCA and debate team.[^2] He was also part of Alpha Phi Alpha. He graduated from Rutgers in 1926, and in the same year, enrolled at Yale Law School. However, he left after only a year. In 1930, he enlisted in the New York National Guard and served in the 369th Infantry Regiment.[^3] He soon moved to New Jersey where he was elected to the vestry of the Church of Epiphany in Orange, New Jersey in 1933.[^4] By 1938, he was an assistant manager of the Douglas-Harrison Apartments, the largest Black housing project at the time, and served as president of the Newark Student Camp. \n\nHe was set to marry Helen L. Hearnes, associate director of the Crispus Attucks Community Center when, in June of 1938, Winge embezzled $2,000 from the apartment office and went on the run. Winge went on the run for seven weeks where he travelled across the country on what he called a \u201cSee America Tour\u201d.[^5] He evaded police under a false pseudonym and stayed with acquaintances and friends he made when working at the YMCA and the army. The heist was elevated to the national spotlight as a manhunt for Winge ensued with handbills of him were sent to police departments across the country.[^6]\n\nThe case also gained attention as the previous manager of the housing project was Roscoe C. Bruce who shared a similar background as a Harvard graduate and a member of Omega Psi Phi.[^7] He contacted his sister and surrendered himself to detectives where he explained a loophole he found in the accounting to supplement his low wage. In July, he was sentenced to two years of hard labor at Trenton State Prison but later reduced to 18 months at Essex County Penitentiary.[^8]\n\nHe moved to Philadelphia in the 1940s and married Inetta M. West. He was employed at the Pennsylvania Forge Company and served as a lay reader at St. Simon\u2019s Church.[^9] He died on June 20th, 1966, and is buried at Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania.\n\n Image citation: Rutgers College. _Scarlet Letter_, 1926.
