    "biographyMarkdown": "# Albert Morris Thomas, Jr.\n## Graduate of Yale Law School, 1884\n\nAlbert Morris Thomas, Jr. was born enslaved in Charleston, Virginia (now West Virginia), to Albert Morris Thomas and an unknown mother in 1853. There are two conflicting accounts surrounding his childhood. In one account, his father, Albert Sr., escaped from slavery in 1853 and moved to Buffalo, New York, later serving in the Civil War in the Union Army.[^1] Another account claims that both father and son escaped during the Civil War in a skiff heading towards Ohio.[^2]   \n\nThe pair eventually moved to Raleigh, Tennessee, by 1870 where Albert Sr. married Mary, his third wife. The family served as caterers and event coordinators in the town for members of both the Black and white community.[^3] Albert Sr. and Mary also ran a hotel called \u201cUncle Tom and Aunt Mary\u2019s Hotel\u201d and sold spring water.[^4] According to a news article in the local press, the family received praise from the \u201cRedeemers\u201d in Tennessee for their alignment with the Democrats and were promoted by local white Tennesseans as a model Black family.[^5] \n\nThomas, Jr. attended Fisk University in Memphis, Tennessee, where he graduated with high honors and was known in Memphis as a talented orator.[^6] Following his graduation, he became the principal of Memphis High School.[^7] According to The Daily Memphis Avalanche, Thomas knew French, Spanish, and Latin and was studying under a judge to prepare for the bar before matriculating to Yale Law School in 1883.[^8] While studying at Yale, Thomas made trips to Buffalo, New York, to investigate an inheritance claim that his father had made.[^9] He attended Yale Law School for one  year and graduated in 1884.[^10]  \n\nFollowing his graduation, Thomas married Amy Henrietta Cassey in 1884 in Craven, North Carolina.[^11] In that same year, he moved to Buffalo, New York, and became one of the only Black lawyers in the city. Throughout his time in Buffalo, he remained an active member of the Republican Party. In the summer of 1884, he campaigned and made speeches on behalf of the party to encourage Black people to vote in the 1884 elections.[^12] In 1888, he spoke to a delegation of Black supporters of Benjamin Harrison for the 1888 presidential election.[^13] Following the Republican victory in 1888, the Buffalo Republican Party offered Thomas as a potential candidate for an ambassadorship to Haiti, expecting him to succeed John Edward West Thompson, another Black alumnus who graduated from Yale Medical School in 1883. However, Frederick Douglass received the appointment.[^14] Thomas instead became a notary for the city of Buffalo.[^15] In 1890, he sued a cafe for their refusal to serve him because of his race.[^16] The story gained traction nationwide, but Thomas later dismissed the suit after receiving an apology from the owner.[^17]  \n\nThomas was elected president of the Colored Men\u2019s Republican League in 1895, 1896, and 1897. However, by 1900, he had become disillusioned with the party. He switched parties and was elected to Buffalo\u2019s Democratic Club where he campaigned for William Jennings Bryan and the Democratic Party in the 1900 elections. In an interview with the Buffalo Courier, he told the newspaper of his regret for supporting the Republican Party following their annexation of the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War.[^18] In 1901, he was selected to be representative of Black Buffalonians at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo.  In 1904, out of almost 100 applicants, Albert M. Thomas scored the highest for a senior clerkship job and began his role as an assistant clerk.[^19] He served for about a year before he tendered his resignation in 1906 to launch a law firm with Junius C. Ayler (who attended Yale Law School between 1898 and 1899) in New York City: Ayler & Thomas.[^20] However, Thomas shortly died in December of that year in Brooklyn, New York from kidney inflammation.[^21] He was survived by his wife, two sons, and four daughters; his eldest son was studying at Dartmouth College at the time.[^22] \n\nImage citation: *The Buffalo News*, 12 December 1906, page 6.\n\n[^1]:  \u201cA Remarkable Case,\u201d *The New York Times*, May 31, 1886, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/05/31/103115447.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0. \n[^2]:  \u201cEducated Negro Stump Speaker,\u201d *Auxvasse Review*, February 1, 1901, https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/1025344177/?match=2&terms=%22Albert%20M.%20Thomas%22%20%22skiff%22&pqsid=ztLoLYTv96nN5nW6K8Mcqg%3A865650%3A993365750. \n[^3]:  \u201cBreviters,\u201d *Public Ledger*, July 27, 1871, https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/586930704/?match=1&terms=%22Uncle%20Tom%22%20%22Aunt%20Mary%22&pqsid=sd006tXxfpcPr-Tel2bkOg%3A588779%3A603308813; \u201cThe Colored Old Folks Barbecue,\u201d The Daily Memphis Avalanche, August 24, 1873, https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/586665411/?match=1&terms=%22Uncle%20Tom%22%20%22Aunt%20Mary%22&pqsid=sd006tXxfpcPr-Tel2bkOg%3A588779%3A603308813. \n[^4]:  \u201cRaleigh Mineral Springs Water,\u201d *Public Ledger*, April 29, 1880. https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/171515384/?match=1&terms=%22Uncle%20Tom%22%20%22Aunt%20Mary%22&pqsid=sd006tXxfpcPr-Tel2bkOg%3A295190%3A485244804. \n[^5]:  \u201cNotice To The Public,\u201d *Memphis Daily Appeal*, August 3, 1870, https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/39794695/?match=1&terms=%22Uncle%20Tom%22%20%22Aunt%20Mary%22&pqsid=sd006tXxfpcPr-Tel2bkOg%3A588779%3A603308813. \n[^6]:  \u201cPersonals,\u201d *Memphis Daily Appeal*, May 29, 1881, https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/168578366/?match=1&terms=%22Albert%20Thomas%22%20%22high%20school%22&pqsid=sd006tXxfpcPr-Tel2bkOg%3A5297551%3A187912452; \u201cA Worthy Young Man,\u201d *The Daily Memphis Avalanche*, August 22, 1880, https://newscomwc.newspapers.com/image/587075455/?match=1&terms=%22Albert%20Thomas%22%20%22principal%22%20%22school%22%20%22fisk%22&pqsid=sd006tXxfpcPr-Tel2bkOg%3A5394296%3A1426360064.   \n[^7]:  *Biographies of Graduates of the Yale Law School*. 1824-1899.
