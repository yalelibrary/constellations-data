After graduating from New Haven High\nSchool, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1895 and a master\u2019s degree in 1899, both from Yale.\nIn June 1895, he gave a lecture on introductory philosophy for students in Yale\u2019s Osborn Hall.\nHe went on to study at the Harvard Divinity School and earned a master\u2019s degree in journalism\nfrom Harvard in 1900.\n\nAfter receiving his degrees, Ferris worked as a teacher, A. M. E. minister, lecturer, and\njournalist. In 1913, he published a two-volume book *The African Abroad*, which traces the\nhistory of Black people in Europe and the Americas. A critic of Booker T. Washington\u2019s industrial\neducational philosophy, Ferris aligned himself more closely with the intellectual Alexander\nCrummell as well as W. E. B. Du Bois and the Niagara movement. In 1920, Ferris wrote\n*Alexander Crummell: An Apostle of Negro Culture*, published by the American Negro Academy,\nthe organization Crummell founded.\n\nFerris became a supporter of Marcus Garvey and his brand of political and economic black\nnationalism. Best known for the \u201cBack-to-Africa\u201d movement, Garvey led the Universal Negro\nImprovement Association (UNIA), the largest organization of Black people in American history.\nIn 1919, Ferris was elected Assistant General President of the UNIA and served as literary\neditor of its newspaper, *The Negro World*, with a circulation of 200,000 copies. In 1922, he was\npart of a UNIA delegation that petitioned the League of Nations to give African land colonized by\nGermany to Black people to establish a homeland. In the 1930s, he served as Dean of the\nGlasgow Normal and Theological Institute in Glasgow, Kentucky. He died in 1941.\n\nImage citation: Yale College Class of 1895 class book, Yale University Library\n",
